A Case Study of Viz.ai, Top 10 AI Technology Startups

Introduction
Viz.ai is a software company that is the leading care of artificial intelligence. Their mission is to use artificial intelligence to accelerate care coordination for healthcare patients, and reducing systemic delays that stand between patients and life-saving treatments; thus, providing an innovative way of using technology to transform clinical workflow and patient care. (Viz.ai. n.d.) [^8] The AI-powered Viz.ai Platform identifies more patients with a particular disease and then informs all critical decisions at this point of care, and optimizes care pathways to help improve the outcomes. (Viz.ai. 2023). [^7]
Story
Viz.ai’s motive was inspired by a patient that underwent brain surgery. Later, the patient passed away due to the surgery being too late from the process delays. The founders, Chief Executive Officer, Chris Mansi, dedicated his time to find a better way, then joined with machine learning post-doc, Dr. David Golan, and Consultant Paediatric, Young Adult Orthopaedic and Trauma surgeon, Manoj Ramachandran. The goal was to use artificial intelligence to create healthcare work faster and smarter; not only to improve and change it, but to transform it. (Viz.ai. n.d.). [^8]
Background
Viz.ai acquired their date of incorporation on January 01, 2000. They were founded in 2016 located in San Franscisco, California. Viz.ai serves in the B2B, SaaS space in the High Tech, FinTech, HealthTech, and Life Sciences market segments of which their funding is acquired from these capital firms. (Tracxn. 2023.) [^5] As of March 22, 2023, Viz.ai has funded a total of $252M. Thus far, covering more than 220 million lives across 1,400+ hospitals and health care systems in the U.S. and Europe. (Viz.ai. 2023). [^6]
Business Activities
Viz.ai uses Viz.ai One Suite which consists of six AI suites: Viz Neuro, Viz Cardio, and Viz Vascular, Viz Trauma, Viz Radiology, and Viz Connect. Viz Neuro tailors to accelerate the detection and treatment of suspected neuro diseases. Viz Cardio provides solutions developed to meet cardiovascular needs. Viz Vascular provides solutions designed to transform patient outcomes in vascular medicine. Viz Trauma streamlines communication and improving patient outcomes within the trauma center guidelines. Viz Radiology accelerates patient diagnosis and treatment enabling radiologists to optimize their time for informed decisions and recommendations. Viz Connect provides a proprietary communication and workflow tool that unites multidisciplinary specialists and care teams across therapeutic areas to direct more patients to faster follow-ups. (Viz.ai. n.d.). [^9] Viz.ai One Suite is preparing for the future of the healthcare industry; therefore, providing high-quality, personalized care: this includes convenience, personalization and accessibility. (West Monroe. 2022.). [^10]  These artificial intelligence tools are exclusive to Viz.ai that is also very similar to their competitors: Aidoc, RapidAI, Brainomix, and 16-Bit (CB Insights. n.d.). [^3] Viz.ai’s broader portfolio of AI algorithms covers all major branches of medicine: neurology, cardiology, and vascular.
Business Metrics
Viz.ai is the only company in healthcare to be recognized for the fourth time that was announced in the 2023 Forbes AI 50 list. (Viz.ai. 2023.) [^7] Some of the core metrics that Viz.ai measures are work culture, professional, development, outlook, and teams. (Comparably. n.d.) [^4] My company, Assurant, focuses on all aspects of working as a team and any personal development. Our company’s goal is to help clients and customers protect what is important to them: their home, their personal property, and their ability to recover from natural, personal, and financial catastrophes. (Assurant. n.d.) [^2] Assurant has measures of customer service, how to better assist with improving the process of both protection of personal property and how to better assist with processing documentation to get quicker and efficient results. Assurant leverages generative AI to not only to be more successful than other competitors, but also to explore a variety of applications that would better assist with new use cases with machine learning algorithms and existing data patterns. (Assurant. 2023.) [^1]
Recommendations
To improve on future products and services for Viz.ai, I would recommend using Chat GPT, created by OpenAI, which is an artificial intelligence that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. (WhatIs.com. n.d.) [^11] This is a form of generative AI that is the next generation of artificial intelligence that can put Viz.ai ahead of the competition. By utilizing Chat GPT, this will benefit with creating new content, accelerate certain tasks, and to better prepare for the inevitable; therefore, avoiding delays and to better tie back to the vision of using artificial intelligence to make health care work faster and smarter, and to radically transform it. (Viz.ai. n.d.). [^8]
